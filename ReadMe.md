# Restful Refactor: <span style="color:green">Google</span> <span style="color:blue">Books</span

### **Description:**

[Google Books](https://github.com/SmithCray/RestfulRefactor) is a fully functioning [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) search engine built with a RESTful API using the [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) and a [React](https://reactjs.org/) front end, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database, and [Node.js/Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) server and API. Which allows users to save book searches to the back end, sign-in and out, and query Books data all while being presenting with a high-quality responsive and enjoyable user experience via our friend _**"React"**_. Our users are presented with a menu containing the options Search for Books and Login/Signup, as well as a input field to search for books. Google Books presents several search results, each featuring a bookâ€™s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site.

<br>

### **Our Mission:**

We are working to refactor Gooogle Books API and incorperate new performant technologies including [Apollo Servers](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started/) and [GraphQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL) replacing the existing restful API currently used. In addition we will Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the correct context in GraphQL API. Last we will need to create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

<span style="color:orange">**Initial Issues and Diclaimer:**</span>

We are currrently experiencing a bug within our starting structure that is causing issues with the deployed product. We are working to fix this issue and have not been able to determine the a solution and are working around the clock to de-bug and determine the root of the issue.

In addition to the initial struggles with Heroku during deployment we struggled with alot of error and trouble shooting while learning how to use _graphQl_ and _mongodb_ as well as working with [apollo/react-hooks](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react/hooks/).

While we are still working to resolve issues and moving forward solving errors one at a time, this line of code from **"heroku logs --tail"** has been a recurring issue.

                2022-02-04T07:16:15.935108+00:00 heroku[router]: at=error code=H10 desc="App crashed" method=GET path="/"

After recent success we are happy to move on to the next issue at hand which appears to be a login issue after post, we plan to continue to work on the product's functionality behind the scenes and re-establish its original operations.

<span style="color:green">**Updates:**</span>

Heroku deployment fixed, issue was cause by initial build pack that was intended for a static single page application. By removing current status buildpack and running a react/heroku default build as well as backend mongo atlas verification fixed.

In addition to Heroku's original success with the help of the a few tutors and TA's we were able to start building out our [mutations and typeDefs](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/) as well as connect to our mongoDb Atlas creating a google books collection containing users. While we are working on addition features the api functionality is working properly now as well.

Overall the ability to use _graphQl_ and _heroku logs_ working together helped alot to solve issues within my _mutations_ and _typedefs_. in addition alot of initial problems were created during the building of the code in terms of spelling or case errors. _"Never code when you are tired"._
